## What is it?

The AIArena Hackathon is a group competition centred around AI Programming for a particular game.
A game is chosen (in this case prepared by us), and the challenge is for your group to program a bot that outperforms all others in the game.
The details of this game will be released a week before the contest is held.

It should also be stressed that **'AI' is not synonomous with Machine Learning!**. Any sort of strategy, no matter how simple, fits under the broad term AI. That being said you may utilise machine learning if you feel so inclined.

This year, all bots will need to be written in *Python* to function, due to some limitations. Don't worry if you haven't programmed in Python before, as it is rather easy to pick up.

## When / Where is it?

Where: TBA - Somewhere on the Clayton Campus.

When: Saturday 10th April (Midsem break), with the game and rules being revealed on the 3rd of April.
