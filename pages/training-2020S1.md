### How does the online training work?
Every Friday night, I will prepare a problem set with moderate difficulty and publish [online](https://vjudge.net/group/monashicpc).
For those who want to participate, please register an account and join our group (click "Join now" at top-right corner).
Contests will keep running until **24, April** , one day before the MCPC-2020.

In training contests, collaboration is allowed - you can discuss with others; 
but copy-pasting is disallowed, any confirmed behaviour may disqualify you from MCPC.

Join our discord channel for instant communication: [https://discord.gg/KC9hJRN](https://discord.gg/KC9hJRN).

### Credit system
Passing an unsolved problem in the contest will give you some credits, you will be qualified to participate MCPC only if you have **more than 100** credits.
Each problem may have different weight based on the difficulty or recommendation level, the following table shows an example.
